This m-file contains the code for the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations using a Finite Volume Method and a pressure correction
method.
- horizontal numbering of volumes
- 2nd and 4th order spatial (central) discretization convection and diffusion
- general boundary conditions different fourth order BC ("verstappen") can be used by changing
addpath("spatial/boundaryconditions/proposed") to addpath("spatial/boundaryconditions/verstappen") check operator_convection_diffusion construction of Duy and Dvx
